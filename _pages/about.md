I am an aspiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R programming. I specialize in machine learning techniques, and data wrangling. As a proud HBCU graduate of Morehouse College, I have an exposure to a wide array of subjects. I love working on diverse and unique projects, so feel free to reach out for collaborations!
