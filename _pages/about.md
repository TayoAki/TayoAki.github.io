I am an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R programming. I specialize in machine learning techniques, and data wrangling. After earning a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Morehouse College, I decided to continue my education and pursue a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from North Carolina A&T State University. I am seeking exciting opportunities to meet new people and work with new data so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
