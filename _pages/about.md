I am a machine learning and data science enthusiast with a passion for analyzing, dissecting, and manipulating data sets. After earning a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Morehouse College, I decided to continue my education and pursue a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from North Carolina A&T State University- where I honed my programming skills in python, R studio and SQL. 
I am seeking exciting opportunities to work with new data in the Atlanta area and would love to connect with you!
